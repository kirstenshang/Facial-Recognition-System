1. Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology of facial recognition system, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video and it compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match. Facial recognition can help verify personal identity, and this can be put into use on daily phone security or facial detection on applications like Snapchat. This technology is used by the government and the citizens at the same time. But facial recognition system also raises privacy issues. Facial recognition system works on a grand, algorithmic scale. It works first by capturing a picture of your face from a photo or video. Then the facial recognition software reads the geometry of your face. Key factors include the distance between your eyes and the distance from forehead to chin. The software identifies facial landmarks — one system identifies 68 of them — that are key to distinguishing your face. And this results in your facial signature. And then your facial signature, which is just a mathematical formula, is compared to a database of known faces. At last, a determination is made. Your faceprint may match that of an image in a facial recognition system database.


2. Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

Woody Bledsoe (1960s): he is an American mathematician, computer scientist, and prominent educator. Working in the 1960s, Bledsoe developed a system that could classify photos of faces by hand using what’s known as a RAND tablet, a device that people could use to input horizontal and vertical coordinates on a grid using a stylus that emitted electromagnetic pulses. The system could be used to manually record the coordinate locations of various facial features including the eyes, nose, hairline and mouth. These metrics could then be inserted in a database. Then, when the system was given a new photograph of an individual, it was able to retrieve the image from the database that most closely resembled that individual. At the time, face recognition was unfortunately limited severely by the technology of the era and computer processing power. However, it was an important first step in proving that face recognition was a viable biometric.

Peter E. Hart: he is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur. Peter continued Bledsoe's study at the Stanford Research Institute.

Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk(1970s)：They used 21 specific subjective markers including lip thickness and hair color in order to identify faces automatically， which increased the accuracy. As with Bledsoe’s system, the actual biometrics had to still be manually computed.

Sirovich and Kirby(late1980s - early 1990s): applying linear algebra to the problem of facial recognition. 

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology(1993-2000s): they rolled out the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program involved creating a database of facial images. The database was updated in 2003 to include high-resolution 24-bit color versions of images. Included in the test set were 2,413 still facial images representing 856 people. 

SuperBowl: At the 2002 Super Bowl, law enforcement officials used facial recognition in a major test of the technology. While officials reported that several “petty criminals” were detected, overall the test was seen as a failure. False positives and backlash from critics proved that face recognition wasn’t quite ready for prime time. One of the big technological limitations at the time was that face recognition did not yet work well in large crowds, functionality that is essential to using face recognition for event security.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)(2000s): they began the Face Recognition Vendor Tests (FRVT).

FaceBook: Beginning in 2010, Facebook began implementing facial recognition functionality that helped identify people whose faces may be featured in the photos that Facebook users update daily. While the feature was instantly controversial with the news media, sparking a slew of privacy-related articles, Facebook users at large did not seem to mind. Having no apparent negative impact on the website’s usage or popularity, more than 350 million photos are uploaded and tagged using face recognition each day.

IphoneX(2017): Apple released the iPhone X in 2017, advertising face recognition as one of it’s primary new features. The face recognition system in the phone is used for device security. The new model of iPhone sold out almost instantly, proving that consumers now accept facial recognition as the new gold standard for security.

3. What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?

(1) What became known as the Eigenface approach started as a search for a low-dimensional representation of facial images. Sirovich and Kriby were able to show that feature analysis on a collection of facial images could form a set of basic features. They were also able to show that less than one hundred values were required in order to accurately code a normalized face image. In 1991, Turk and Pentland expanded upon the Eigenface approach by discovering how to detect faces within images. This led to the first instances of automatic face recognition. Their approach was constrained by technological and environmental factors, but it was a significant breakthrough in proving the feasibility of automatic facial recognition.

(2)the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program encourage the commercial face recognition market. The hope of the project was that a large database of test images for facial recognition would be able to inspire innovation, that might result in more powerful facial recognition technology.

(3) In 2009, the Pinellas County Sherriff’s Office created a forensic database that allowed officers to tap into the photo archives of the state’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV). By 2011, about 170 deputies had been outfitted with cameras that let them take pictures of suspects that could be cross-checked against the the database. This resulted in more arrests and criminal investigations than would have otherwise been possible.

(4)In 2011, the government of Panama, partnering with then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, authorized a pilot program of FaceFirst’s facial recognition platform in order to cut down on illicit activity in Panama’s Tocumen airport (known as a hub for drug smuggling and organized crime). Shortly after implementation, the system resulted in the apprehension of multiple Interpol suspects. Pleased with the success of the initial deployment, FaceFirst expanded into the facility’s north terminal. The FaceFirst implementation at Tocumen remains the largest biometrics installation at an airport to date.
